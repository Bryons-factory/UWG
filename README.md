# About the project  
This project is the solution for the intercollegiate rocket competition set up by Wisconsin Space Grant	
Consortium (WSGC) which is a branch of the NASA  space Grant program.

# Who are we:  
We are the CS arm of the 2023 University of Wisconsin - Green Bay rocket team.   
Lead by:  
[Bryon Cobb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryon-cobb-34380a251/)  
[Jared Guidry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jguidry/)  

# Our Objective  
The design of the rocket must allow for a dual deployment and capture an image of a designated ground target, at, or after reaching apogee. The rocket must be able to confirm and signal a “systems ready, stand-by" status, collect downward-facing video of the rocket’s flight, implement a downed rocket location aid, and house altimeters provided by both the competing team and WSGC.    Competing teams will be judged on the ability to demonstrate knowledge and communicate, the performance of design, and the expertise of fabrication.   These skills will be accomplished through a design report, a presentation to judges, the flight of the rocket, an examination of predicted versus actual rocket performance, project management, and an educational outreach activity.    
There will be simultaneous development of both the rocket and the payload. There are currently weekly meetings to discuss cross implementation of projects to ensure smooth integration. Emphasis will be given to the camera acquisition system as that is what the team defines as most important.
